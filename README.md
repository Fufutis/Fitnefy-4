Just like in fallout what if you could do stats for the human body and turn it into a game. 
eventually with enough people if i could get a system running for comparing everyone to set the stats for themselves so the moment you surpass a % of people your stat goes up 
and by being in the top 1% you are able to get the max stat on that
