Just like in fallout what if you could do stats for the human body and turn it into a game. 
eventually with enough people if i could get a system running for comparing everyone to set the stats for themselves so the moment you surpass a % of people your stat goes up 
and by being in the top 1% you are able to get the max stat on that

apply the workouts through the stats make em clickable + creates a scrilling mech within the the page + make custom page for the people so by pressing + you can create a new html and the system stuff and custom add the workouts.
current idea is to make it a litle more competitive 1 add leader boards through different accounts (db getting the stats)

(future note for self. each workout increases the stat it would aslo be nice to do muscle groups aswell could be adjusted by settings)
